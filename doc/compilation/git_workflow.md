# Git feature development workflow

- The main branch is the stable branch of the project, it is designed to
  remain "clean" (i.e. tested and documented).
- Work on the project should be performed on *branches*. A branch is created
  for each feature, bug, etc. and progress is committed on that branch.
- Once the work is ready to *merge* (i.e. the code is complete, tested and
  documented) it can be submitted for review: the process is called *merge
  request*. Follow Github's instructions to submit a pull request.
- The request is then reviewed by one of the project's maintainers. After
  discussions, it should eventually be merged to the main branch by the
  maintainer.
- The branch on which the work was performed can then be deleted (the history is
  preserved). The branch commits will be squashed before the merge (this can
  be done in Github's web interface).
- If the main branch has changed between the beginning of the work and the
  pull request submission, the branch should be *rebased* to the main branch
  (in practice, tests should be run after a rebase to avoid potential
  regressions).
    - In some cases, unexpected rebase are reported (for instance if the history
      is A&#x2013;B&#x2013;C and B is merged to A, a later rebase of C to A may cause
      conflicts that should not exist). In such cases, two fixes are possible:
        - Launching an interactive rebase (`git rebase -i <main branch>`) and dropping the commits that would be
          duplicated.
    - After a rebase, `git push` by default will not allow an update that is not `fast-forward`
      with the corresponding remote branch, causing an error when trying to push.
      `git push --force-with-lease` can be used to force a push while checking that the remote branch has not changed.
      Note that this will lose history
