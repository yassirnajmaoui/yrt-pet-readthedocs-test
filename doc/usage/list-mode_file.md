# List-mode file
The default YRT-PET list-mode file is a record of all the events to be
considered for the reconstruction.

```
Timestamp for event 0 (ms) (uint32)
Detector1 of the event 0 (uint32)
Detector2 of the event 0 (uint32)
TOF position of event 0 (ps) (float32) [Optional]
Timestamp for event 1 (ms) (uint32)
Detector1 of the event 1 (uint32)
Detector2 of the event 1 (uint32)
TOF position of event 1 (ps) (float32) [Optional]
...
```

The file extension used is `.lmDat` by convention.
The detectors specified in the List-Mode correspond to the indices in the
scanner's LUT.

If the ListMode file contains time-of-flight (TOF) information, the option
`--flag_tof` must be used in the executable(s).  The TOF value is the difference
of arrival time between detector 2 (t2) and detector 1 (t1): t2 - t1, expressed
in picoseconds.


## For Python users

If using python bindings, here's how to read a ListModeLUT:

```python
import pyyrtpet as yrt

scanner = yrt.Scanner("myscanner.json")
flag_tof = True  # Indicate whether the list-mode file contains a TOF field
lm = yrt.ListModeLUTOwned(scanner, "mylistmode.lmDat", flag_tof=flag_tof)
```

The `flag_tof` option specifies if the list-mode contains TOF information for
each event.

# List-Mode-DOI file

A more advanced List-Mode format is available for scanners with DOI layers. The
format is similar to the regular List-mode format described above with DOI layer
(encoded in 256 bits) for each detector (from the inward face of the detector).
The `num_layers` option in the reconstruction executable allows binning of the
DOI layers from 256 layers to an arbitrary number of layers.

```
Timestamp for event 0 (ms) (uint32)
Detector1 of the event 0 (uint32)
DOI1 of the event 0 (uint8)
Detector2 of the event 0 (uint32)
DOI2 of the event 0 (uint8)
TOF position of event 0 (ps) (float32) [Optional]
Timestamp for event 1 (ms) (uint32)
Detector1 of the event 1 (uint32)
DOI1 of the event 1 (uint8)
Detector2 of the event 1 (uint32)
DOI2 of the event 2 (uint8)
TOF position of event 1 (ps) (float32) [Optional]
...
```
